/*
In object-oriented programming, the SOLID principles are a set of guidelines that help developers create more maintainable, scalable, and flexible software. SOLID stands for:

S - Single Responsibility Principle : A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job or responsibility.

O - Open/Closed Principle : Software entities (classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification.

L - Liskov Substitution Principle : Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.

I - Interface Segregation Principle : Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.

D - Dependency Inversion Principle : High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions.

Each principle focuses on structuring code in a way that ensures clarity, easy maintenance, and good design.


By following the SOLID principles, you ensure your PHP code is more flexible, maintainable, and scalable. These principles help reduce tight coupling, enhance separation of concerns, and make your code easier to extend and modify.

Incorporating SOLID principles into your projects will make your code more robust, adaptable to change, and better structured overall.
