/*
Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions.

Let’s break down each part of the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) individually.

1. High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules.
2. Both should depend on abstractions.
3. Abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions.
